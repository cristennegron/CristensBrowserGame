## Overview
Using HTML, CSS and Javascript, you will be creating a single player version of the Snake game. The player will use their arrow keys to move a "snake" around to try and "eat" an apple. Each time the snake eats an apple, the snake grows in length. When the snake runs into a wall or itself as it grows larger while trying to eat an apple, the player loses and it's game over. 

## Objectives
* Boggle your mind building a 'Snake Game' from scratch using only  HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript
* Have your code be as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) as possible
* Create something you'd be proud to showcase in your portfolio!


## What You'll Be Building
*Include a link to your finished project as an example here.*

## Getting Started
* Fork and clone this repository.
* Run open index.html to open your game in the browser (Mac).
  * cmd + option + i or ctrl + shift + i to open your dev tools in your browser.
* You'll be working in two (2) index.html files, one (1) app.js in the js folder, and one (1) style.css in the css folder.

## Requirements
* The snake must move automatically throughout the game
* Both the locations of the snake and apple must be randomly set each time the game starts
* Arrow keys must make the snake change direction
* The board needs boundary conditions in order for the game to end once the snake collides into it's own body or the border.
* When the snake eats an apple, the snake's body must increase by one increment.
* The game must be infinite until the player collides into itself or the border.


## Bonuses
* Keep a score count 
* Track player's highest score *(until they refresh? maybe create a login as another bonus?)*
* Use spacebar to pause/play the game

## Overview
Using HTML, CSS and Javascript, you will be creating a single player version of the Snake game. The player will use their arrow keys to move the snake around to try and eat as many apples as they can. Each time the snake eats an apple, the snake grows in length. When the snake runs into a wall or itself as it grows larger while trying to eat an apple, the player loses and it's game over. 

## Objectives
* Build your own Snake game from scratch using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript
* Have your code be as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) as possible
* Be sure to style and create something you'd be proud to showcase in your portfolio


## What You'll Be Building
https://stealthysnake.surge.sh/

## Getting Started
* Fork and clone this repository.
* Run open index.html to open your game in the browser (Mac).
  * cmd + option + i or ctrl + shift + i to open your dev tools in your browser.
* You'll be working in two (2) index.html files, one (1) app.js in the js folder, and one (1) style.css in the css folder.

## Requirements
* The snake must move automatically throughout the game
* Both the locations of the snake and apple must be randomly set each time the game starts
* Arrow keys must make the snake change direction
* The board needs boundary conditions in order for the game to end once the snake collides into it's own body or the border.
* When the snake eats an apple, the snake's body must increase by one increment.
* The game must be infinite until the player collides into itself or the border.


## Bonuses
* Keep a score count 
* Track player's highest score 
* Use spacebar to pause/play the game
